# OSG Outreach Area

The goal of the OSG Outreach area is to inform people about Distributed High Throughput Computing
(DHTC) and other topics related to the OSG mission.

## OSG School

The OSG runs the OSG School, an annual education event for researchers who want to learn to use DHTC methods and
tools.  It is held each summer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
