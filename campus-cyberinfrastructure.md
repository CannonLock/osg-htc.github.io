# Campus Cyberinfrastructure Award Recipients Share Resources Using OSG Services

The OSG Consortium operates services like the [Open Science Pool (OSPool)](/about/computation-ideal-for-OSPool/) and the [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](/about/osdf/). The OSPool is founded on the principle of sharing, and any researcher at a US institution can access it through access points like [OSGConnect](connect.osg-htc.org) or a local institutional access point. The capacity that powers these national computing and storage resources is contributed by clusters located at academic and research institutions. [Campus Cyberinfrastructure awardees](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748) play an important role in the value that the OSPool brings to the national S&E community. By sharing their resources, Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) award recipients provide tremendous support for open research.

In 2022, NSF released a new CC* solicitation with a new area for data storage on campuses, providing resources for campuses to share data in the OSDF.

## 235 Million Core Hours Contributed by CC* Campuses

In the last year, twenty-two campuses contributed over 235 million core hours to researchers using distributed high throughput computing (dHTC). (April 2021 - March 2022) These core hours supported over 234 projects in fields of study ranging from the medical sciences to the evolutionary sciences, and from biostatistics to physics. This campus support throughout the United States contributed to the advancement of science and to researchers both on and off their campuses. The campuses currently contributing CC*-funded resources shown in the map below. Every month, the OSG is working to help additional campuses to join this effort to support open science by sharing their resources.

Projects supported by these contributions include (among many others):

- multiple COVID-19 research projects
- virtual screening for pain relief compounds
- light production in heavy-ion collisions
- genomic analyses to understand the evolutionary process of marine invasion
- computer network optimization for large-scale scientific workflows

## The CC* Program

The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports the OSPool, OSDF, and campuses that contribute resources to it. For 2022, the National Science Foundation funds the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 22-582)</a>. This program invests in coordinated campus- and regional-level cyberinfrastructure improvements and innovation. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity.  The 2022 program has two areas, both of which provide opportunities for campuses to work with the OSG Consortium.

The NSF supports awards in 2 CC* program areas:

- Data Storage awards will be supported at up to $500,000 total for up to 2 years.
- Regional Computing awards will be supported at up to $1,000,000 total for up to 2 years.


## OSG Can Help with Your CC* Proposal

The [Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh)](https://path-cc.io) develops technologies and operates services for the OSG Consortium and has significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, offering letters of support and consulting for:

- bringing the power of the OSG to your researchers
- gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources or
- CC*-required resource sharing for the Campus Compute category, and other options for integrating with OSG

In the most recent call for proposals <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 22-582)</a>, joining the OSG is mentioned as a potential path to sharing resources with the wider research community:

The Storage system as a Shared Resource Intra-campus and Inter-campus: Interoperability is required with a national and federated data sharing fabric such as PATh/OSDF (see: [OSDF Page](/about/osdf/)). At least 20% of the disk/storage space on the proposed storage system must be made available as part of the chosen federated data sharing fabric.

The OSG team actively works with campuses to integrate them smoothly into the OSG. We have an experienced and friendly team of engineers and facilitators dedicated to supporting campus research groups and ensuring a positive onboarding with the flexibility to meet your configuration needs. To get started please email [OSG Support](mailto:support@osgconnect.net).

## Contributing to the Open Science Pool

Many other campuses and other sites, in addition to CC* awardees, contribute resources to the OSPool. <a href="https://map.opensciencegrid.org/map/iframe?view=EduvsOther#29.22889,-90.08789|4|terrain" target="_blank">View them here.</a> CC* awardees are a subset of the overall contributions by educational institutions. In fact, campuses have used their OSPool contributions to aid in the success of a subsequent CC* award application to NSF.

## The Open Science Pool is Open to You!

The Open Science Pool is an <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/" target="_blank">HTCondor pool</a> that OSG users access via 'access points' operated by the OSG or by campuses supporting 'local' access to OSG. Any researcher at a US academic, government, or non-profit institution can use the Open Science Pool via OSG-operated access points to harness the capacity of the Open Science Pool by visiting <a href="https://www.osgconnect.net/" target="_blank">OSG Connect and getting an OSG Account</a>. (It's free!) The researcher does not have to belong to a collaboration (big or small) nor to any particular campus (big or small).
