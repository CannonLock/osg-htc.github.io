## [2023 CC* Solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23526/nsf23526.htm)

<div class="border p-3 mt-3 mb-3 pb-0 rounded bg-light" markdown="1">

##### Due Date

March 1st, 2023

##### OSG/PATh Supported Program Areas

The 2023 solicitation has three program areas which explicitly mention
and encourage the use of OSG services to meet requirements.

__(4) Campus Computing and the Computing Continuum__

NSF recommends reaching out to [PATh](https://path-cc.io) for "technical direction/expertise during their proposal
development" and suggests working with the OSG to contribute its "minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster" to the 
[OSPool](/services/open_science_pool).

__(5) Regional Computing awards__


NSF strongly encourages joining PATh, and suggests working with the OSG to contribute its "minimum of 20% shared time on the cluster" to the
[OSPool](/services/open_science_pool).

__(6) Data Storage awards__

NSF solely mentions the OSG's [Open Science Data Federation](/services/osdf.html) as a federated data sharing fabric to share
its required "20% of the disk/storage space on the proposed storage system."
  
##### Eligibility - Who May Submit Proposals

- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) - Two- and four-year IHEs (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in the US, acting on behalf of their faculty members. Special Instructions for International Branch Campuses of US IHEs: If the proposal includes funding to be provided to an international branch campus of a US institution of higher education (including through use of subawards and consultant arrangements), the proposer must explain the benefit(s) to the project of performance at the international branch campus, and justify why the project activities cannot be performed at the US campus.
- Non-profit, non-academic organizations: Independent museums, observatories, research labs, professional societies and similar organizations in the U.S. associated with educational or research activities.

## Let OSG Help with your CC* Proposal

{: .fs-5 }
The [Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh)](https://path-cc.io), which develops technologies 
and operates services for the OSG, has significant experience working with CC* applicants and awardees, and
offering letters of support and consulting for:

{: .fs-5 }
- Sharing data with authorized users via the [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](/services/osdf.html)
- Bringing the power of high throughput computing via the [OSPool](/services/open_science_pool.html) to your researchers
- Gathering science drivers and planning local computing resources
- Meeting CC*-required resource sharing as specified in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 23-526)</a>, and other options for integrating with the OSG Consortium
- Providing connections to help with data storage systems for shared inter-campus or intra-campus resources
  - We have collected [community data storage systems](/organization/osdf/example_data_origin.html) for your consideration
- Building regional computing networks
- Developing science gateways to utilize high throughput computing via the [OSPool](/services/open_science_pool.html)

{: .fs-5 }
CC* applicants are encouraged to email OSG Support with questions or requests for letters of support regarding their CC* proposal.

## OSG’s active support of CC* Awardees

{: .fs-5 }
Our experienced and friendly team of engineers and facilitators is dedicated to 
supporting system engineers and campus research groups. This team provides networking, 
computing and data storage consulting in support of proposals,  providing expertise
and guidance.

{: .fs-5 }
Post award, these teams continue their support to ensure smooth integration and 
onboarding into the OSPool or OSDF. The facilitation team also provides extensive 
support to researchers with regular training, weekly office hours,  documentation, 
videos and more.

### CC* Campus impact on Open Science

{: .fs-5 }
The OSG Consortium has been working with CC* campuses pre and post award for several years. 
These campuses have made significant contributions in support of science, both on their 
own campus and for the entire country.

#### Computing

{: .fs-5 }
In the last year, twenty-two campuses contributed over 235 million core hours to researchers 
via the [OSPool](/services/open_science_pool.html) (April 2021 - March 2022). These contributions supported more than 230 
research groups, campuses, multi-campus collaborations, and gateways, and in fields of 
study ranging from the medicine to economics, and from genomics to physics. Every month,
OSG services help additional campuses to support open science by sharing their resources 
via the OSPool.

#### Data Storage

{: .fs-5 }
As of March 2022, the [Open Science Data Federation](/services/osdf.html) integrates 10 data origins, making data 
accessible via 20 caches, 6 of which are strategically located in the R&E network backbone.
The CC* solicitation of 2022 (NSF 23-526) encourages responses that would add data origins 
or caches at campuses.
