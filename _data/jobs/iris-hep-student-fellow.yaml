  Horizontal scaling of HTTP caches: learn how to automate load-balancing with Kubernetes.
  
  The OSG offers an integrated software stack and infrastructure used by the High-Energy Physics
  community to meet their computational needs. Frontier Squid is part of this software stack and
  acts as an HTTP proxy, caching requests to improve network usage. We seek a fellow to turn our
  existing single cache Kubernetes deployment into one that can scale horizontally using the same
  underlying storage for its cache.
