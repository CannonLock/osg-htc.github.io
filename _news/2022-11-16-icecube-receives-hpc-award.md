The UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing’s (CHTC) collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center on
the IceCube Neutrino Observatory received recognition with the HPCwire 2022 Readers’ Choice Award for Best Use of
High Performance Computing (HPC) in the Cloud (Use Case).

“We have used CHTC and the Open Science Pool (OSPool) for over a decade to perform all large-scale data analysis tasks
and generate Monte Carlo simulations of the instrument’s performance,” notes Francis Halzen, principal investigator of
IceCube and the Hilldale and Gregory Breit Distinguished Professor of Physics. “Without CHTC and OSPool resources we
would simply be unable to make any of IceCube’s groundbreaking discoveries.”
