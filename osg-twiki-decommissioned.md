The OSG TWiki service has been decommissioned
----------------------------------------------

As of January 2017, the OSG TWiki service has been decommissioned and its resources have been moved.
We apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused.  The following areas have been
transitioned to a new hosting system:

   aims to provide OSG _site administrators_ with the necessary information to install, configure,
   and operate site services.
*  [User Support](https://support.opensciencegrid.org): Documentation and support for _researchers_
   interested in using OSG resources.
*  [Security](https://opensciencegrid.org/security): If you need to read about OSG Security
   practices, procedures, or need to contact the security team.
*  [Networking](https://opensciencegrid.org/networking/): This is an entry point for those
   interested in Networking in OSG/WLCG or for those OSG/WLCG users experiencing network problems.
*  [Operations](https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/): Documentation with regards to OSG
   Operations (SLAs, etc.)
*  [Education](https://opensciencegrid.org/outreach/): OSG User School and other OSG teaching
   or training events.
