                The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) is an OSG service designed to support the
                sharing of files staged in autonomous “origins”, for efficient access to those
                files from anywhere in the world via a global namespace and network of caches.
                The OSDF may be used either standalone - allowing data to be downloaded via HTTPS
                - or with HTCondor managing data transfer for compute jobs running on one of the
                many resource pools supported by OSG.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5" >
                For the sake of concreteness, the OSG documentation focuses on implementation
                and usage of the OSDF from within OSG resource pools, and provides examples
                of appropriate HTTP addresses for accessing data in OSG-supported data origins
                from other locations.
            </p>

        <div class="rounded px-3 py-2 bg-light">
            <p class="fs-5" >
                The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) enables users and institutions to make datasets
                available to compute jobs running in distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC)
                environments such as the
                <a href="/services/ospool.html">Open Science Pool (OSPool)</a>. Compute jobs submitted from an
                HTCondor access point (e.g. an
                <a href="/services/access-point">OSG-Operated Access Point</a>) can access data stored in data origins, with
                HTCondor managing  data transfer via the OSDF’s global namespace and data caches.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-0" >
                By providing the distributed data access layer via these data caches,
                jobs running in the OSPool (or any other resource pool) can reduce wide-area
                network consumption, load on the data origins, and latency of data access.

                <li>
                    A researcher wants to share a dataset with their community such that others may process it.

                <li>
                    A researcher produces data on the OSPool that they need
                    to store for future processing or sharing with the community.

                <li>
                    A researcher has a GB to TB-scale dataset that they want
                    to analyze. Their workflow processes the same data many times,
                    thus benefiting greatly from the caching within OSDF.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A researcher curated a dataset they produced, and are hosting on
                    their data origin within OSDF. They now want to free up their disk
                    space at their origin by transferring responsibility for this dataset
                    to somebody else’s data origin without any changes in how the
                    community accesses the data.

                Any US-based academic, government, or non-profit institution may operate a data origin to
                export their users’ data. Researchers using the
                <a href="/services/ospool.html">OSPool</a>
                from an OSG-Operated
                Access Point may also use an OSG operated origin.

                Each
                <a href="/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>origin</em></a>
                can be configured to make data public or private, and can control the rules for sharing.
                For example, OSG-Operated Access Points
                allow users to make their data accessible to all (public)
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-0" >
                Cached and transferred portions of the data may additionally be visible to the administrators
                of the
                <a href="/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>cache</em></a>
                services and of the execution points where a user’s jobs run. Non-public data is
                encrypted when sent over the network, but not on disk.

        <h2 id="who-manages-the-osdf" class="mt-5 mb-4">Who manages the OSDF?</h2>

            <p class="fs-5" >
                Origins in the OSDF are generally managed by the projects or institutions that own the
                underlying storage. Additionally the
                <a href="https://path-cc.io">PATh project</a>
                (which funds many core OSG technologies
                and services) offers options for PATh-hosted origins otherwise owned by and configured
                specifically for relevant organizations, as described
                <a href="/about/osdf/deploying_an_osdf_origin.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-0" >
                The caches are largely managed by OSG staff, who remotely operate the services. Some
                caches are dedicated to a research community or access point; a number of caches are
                specific to the LIGO experiment. For example, the PATh project operates the OSDF data
                origin associated with the OSG-Operated
                Access Points for US-associated research
                projects accessing the
                <a href="/services/ospool.html">OSPool</a>.
                The cache hardware is distributed throughout
                the US, including points of presence in the Internet2 and ESNet networks and
                university facilities such as UW-Madison, Chicago, Syracuse, UCSD, and Nebraska.
