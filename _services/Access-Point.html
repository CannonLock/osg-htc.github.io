                    The OSG Access Point is a researchers entrypoint into their associated computing resource. It provides
                    a location to place their workloads and data to then be submitted and executed elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Designed by <a href="https://htcondor.org">HTCSS Team</a>, the Access Point gives researchers dynamic control
                    over their workload execution. This allows researchers to configure their workload submissions to meet their specific
                    computational needs. This can include configurations that request GPUs, order job executions, or
                    download specific software.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Using an Access Point requires no resources beyond your personal computer, and is designed to be performant
                    no matter your location. Hence our slogan, "Submit Locally, Run Globally".

                    <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org/">OSGConnect</a> provides an OSG operated Access Point that is made
                    available to US-Based Researchers, along with other services to assist their running of HTC workloads.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Using an OSG Access Point, researchers can utilize other OSG resources such as the <a href="{{ '/about/open_science_pool/' | relative_url }}">Open Science Pool</a>
                    and the <a href="{{ '/about/osdf/' | relative_url }}">Open Science Data Federation</a>. These two services provide computational
                    resources and data capacity to execute your workloads at an Access Point.
