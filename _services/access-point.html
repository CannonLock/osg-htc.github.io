                    The OSG Access Point (AP) is a researcher's home for large-scale research computing. Researchers
                    can place their workloads and data on the AP, automate workflows, and utilize global resources.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    With a core powered by <a href="https://htcondor.org">HTCSS</a>, the AP helps the researcher
                    manage their workload execution, allowing researchers to utilize resource pools like the Open Science Pool
                    or the PATh facility. Researchers can run computational jobs, utilize GPUs, move data, and manage
                    complex workflows.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Working with an AP requires no resources beyond your personal computer - it is your "home" on the
                    nation's cyberinfrastructure, leading to our slogan of <i>Submit Locally, Run Globally</i>.

                                The power of the OSG AP comes from its ability to allow researchers to effectively harness
                                their computing capacity. Using an AP researchers can manage their jobs on
                                a diverse set of resources, decreasing their time spent managing workloads, and increasing their
                                computational throughput.
                            </p>

                                The OSG AP connects Cloud and Campus Resources, NSF awarded allocations and free to use resources,
                                such as <a href="/services/open_science_pool">OSPool</a>, in one location accessible by researchers from their laptops.
