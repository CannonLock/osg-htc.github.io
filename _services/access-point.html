                    The OSG offers access points that serve as a researcher's home for their High Throughput
                    Computing work. Researchers can place their workloads and data on the access point, which
                    automates the execution of jobs and data movement across associated resources, like the
                    <a href="open_science_pool.html">Open Science Pool (OSPool)</a> and
                    <a href="osdf.html">Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)</a>.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Working with an access point requires no resources beyond your personal computer - it is your "home"
                    on the nation's cyberinfrastructure, leading to our slogan of Submit Locally, Run Globally.
                </p>

                    Powered by the <a href="https://htcondor.org">HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)</a>, access points can also be configured to support
                    “Bring Your Own Capacity” (BYOC). Researchers and project can use the Access Point to harness
                    capacity for sources such as allocated capacity on national facilities (e.g. XRAC allocations),
                    PATh Facility credits, and commercial cloud resources (including NSFCloud accounts).
