<p>
    The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) is an OSG service designed to support the
    sharing of files staged in autonomous “origins”, for efficient access to those
    files from anywhere in the world via a global namespace and network of caches.
    The OSDF may be used either standalone - allowing data to be downloaded via HTTPS
    - or with HTCondor managing data transfer for compute jobs running on one of the
    many resource pools supported by OSG.
</p>
<p>
    For the sake of concreteness, the OSG documentation focuses on implementation
    and usage of the OSDF from within OSG resource pools, and provides examples
    of appropriate HTTP addresses for accessing data in OSG-supported data origins
    from other locations. To learn how to utilize OSDF as a standalone infrastructure,
    please reach out to the OSG Team through
    <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>How is the Open Science Data Federation integrated with other OSG Services?</h2>
<p>
    The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)enables users and institutions to make datasets
    available to compute jobs running in distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC)
    environments such as the
    <a href="/about/open_science_pool">Open Science Pool (OSPool)</a>. Compute jobs submitted from an
    HTCondor access point (e.g.
    <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org">OSG Connect</a>) can access data stored in data origins, with
    HTCondor managing  data transfer via the OSDF’s global namespace and data caches.
</p>
<p>
    By providing the distributed data access layer via these data caches,
    jobs running in the OSPool (or any other resource pool) can reduce wide-area
    network consumption, load on the data origins, and latency of data access.
</p>

<h2>Example OSDF Use Case</h2>
<p>
    A researcher wants to share a dataset with their community such that others may process it.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A researcher produces data on the OPool that they need
        to store for future processing or sharing with the community.
    </li>
    <li>
        A researcher has a GB to TB-scale dataset that they want
        to analyze. Their workflow processes the same data many times,
        thus benefiting greatly from the caching within OSDF.
    </li>
    <li>
        A researcher curated a dataset they produced, and are hosting on
        their data origin within OSDF. They now want to free up their disk
        space at their origin by transferring responsibility for this dataset
        to somebody else’s data origin without any changes in how the
        community accesses the data.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To learn more details about these or other use cases, please reach out to our team
    of Research Computing Facilitators through

</p>

<h2>Who can use the OSDF?</h2>
<p>
    Any US-based academic, government, or non-profit institution may operate a data origin to
    export their users’ data. Researchers using the
    <a href="/about/open_science_pool">OSPool</a>
    from an
    <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org">OSG Connect</a>
    access point may also use the OSG Connect origin.
</p>

<h2>Who can access data in the OSDF?</h2>
<p>
    Each
    <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>origin</em></a>
    can be configured to make data public or private, and can control the rules for sharing.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the
    <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org">OSG Connect</a>
    service allows users to make their data accessible to all (public)
</p>
<p>
    Cached and transferred portions of the data may additionally be visible to the administrators
    of the
    <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/#architecture"><em>cache</em></a>
    services and of the execution points where a user’s jobs run. Non-public data is
    encrypted when sent over the network, but not on disk.
</p>

<h2>Who manages the OSDF?</h2>
<p>
    Origins in the OSDF are generally managed by the projects or institutions that own the
    underlying storage. Additionally the
    <a href="https://path-cc.io">PATh project</a>
    (which funds many core OSG technologies
    and services) offers options for PATh-hosted origins otherwise owned by and configured
    specifically for relevant organizations, as described
    <a href="/about/osdf/deploying_an_osdf_origin.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The caches are largely managed by OSG staff, who remotely operate the services. Some
    caches are dedicated to a research community or access point; a number of caches are
    specific to the LIGO experiment.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the PATh project operates the OSDF data
    origin associated with the PATh-operated OSG Connect service for US-associated research
    projects accessing the
    <a href="/about/open_science_pool">OSPool</a>.
    The cache hardware is distributed throughout
    the US, including points of presence in the Internet2 and ESNet networks and
    university facilities such as UW-Madison, Chicago, Syracuse, UCSD, and Nebraska.
