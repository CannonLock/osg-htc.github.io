The MyOSG and OIM services have been decommissioned
---------------------------------------------------

As a part of the larger [spring 2018 service migration](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/service-migrations-spring-2018/),
the OIM and MyOSG services that used to be at _oim.grid.iu.edu_ and _myosg.grid.iu.edu_ have
been decommissioned.  We apologize for any inconvenience.

The MyOSG XML queries have been migrated to [my.opensciencegrid.org](https://my.opensciencegrid.org); other than a hostname
change, the URL paths and query parameters are identical.  If you see any unexpected changes
in the XML structure, please contact us at [help@osg-htc.org](mailto:help@osg-htc.org)
and we will be happy to assist you.

The reference topology (sites, resource, and services) and contact information kept in OIM are now
kept in internal repositories; if you need to make changes for your site, please contact
[support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org).
