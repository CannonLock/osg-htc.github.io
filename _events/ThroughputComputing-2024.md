**Save the Date for HTC24 - July 8 - 12 in Madison, WI:** 

Save the dates for HTC24! Join us for the second annual integrated Throughput Computing event — which combines HTCondor’s former annual event “HTCondor Week” and the OSG’s “All-Hands Meeting” — from July 8-12 to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s [Fluno Center](https://fluno.com/). HTC24 is sponsored by the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team and the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing. 


Registration will open in March. This will primarily be an in-person event, but remote participation (via Zoom) for the many plenary events will also be offered.
If you register for the in-person event at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, you can attend plenary and non-plenary sessions, mingle with colleagues, and have planned or ad hoc meetings. Evening events are also planned throughout the week.


### Schedule

All the topics typically covered by HTCondor Week and the OSG All-Hands Meeting will be included:

- Science Enabled by the OSPool and the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)
- OSG Technology
