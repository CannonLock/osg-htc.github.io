# OSG Code of Conduct

The OSG believes that a culture of inclusion,
integrity, and cooperation is necessary to achieve its scientific goals,
by affording all members the opportunity to reach their full potential.
All OSG members, participants, vendors, staff, volunteers, conference and workshop attendees, invited speakers,
and all other stakeholders are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner
that is welcoming to all and free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.
OSG members pledge to treat each other with respect and
strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and allow for respectful disagreement.

All participants in OSG activities will not engage in any inappropriate actions or statements that
are derogatory or defamatory on the basis of individual characteristics
such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status,
nationality, political affiliation, ability, status, educational background and/or socioeconomic background,
neurodiversity, mental or physical health, or any characteristics protected by law.
Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.
Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language,
unwelcoming jokes or comments, offensive images, photography without permission, and stalking.

Participants in OSG activities are encouraged to resolve any perceived breach of respectful decorum
in a professional and informal manner before escalation.
If an individual does not feel comfortable confronting the violation
and/or believes someone has violated the code of conduct and it has not been addressed,
they should report it by emailing [conduct@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:conduct@opensciencegrid.org)
or discussing it with one of the standing OSG CoC appointees[^1]
who will follow-up on the reported violation in a confidential manner.
The appointees will determine ways of redressing the matter and counsel the parties involved.
Sanctions may be issued and range from verbal warning,
ejection from a meeting without refund,
removal of subscription from a forum or mailing list,
revocation of access to OSG services,
up to notifying appropriate authorities.
Retaliation against the CoC appointees
or the individual(s) reporting inappropriate conduct
will not be tolerated.
Appeals of sanctions for off-meeting violations,
with long term impacts,
may be directed to the OSG Council co-chairs.
