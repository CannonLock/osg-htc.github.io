The OSG Consortium is moving to using Google Groups for managing mailing lists that end in ```osg-htc.org```. This page 
describes how to manage your membership in these lists.

[support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org)**

1. Decide on the email you would to subscribe to the mailing list
   - If this email is associated with a Google account then use the [website to join](#joining-via-the-website).
